      this is a progressive web app designed for use on ipads. the app will be used by pre-kindergarten teachers to collect data 
      on their children, which will then be used for risk prediction and prevention. the data we are working with is sensitive and legally protected,
      therefore a lot of effort is going into security and adherance to privacy laws. overall, it's very fun and a great learning experience working with 
      this kind of data.
