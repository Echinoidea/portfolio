      this is just a simple cli application to manage my timesheets since my
      research projects are independent and i have to log my hours. it also
      helps for some other tasks i like to time like time spent working on a
      particular project or programming language.

      honestly, i'm not that impressed by this project, i just wanted a third
      project on my website. im working on some better personal projects right
      now.
