      i've been teaching programming to kids and teens since summer 2023. it's a
      great job, especially for a college student.
    </p>

    <p>
      a lot of kids want to learn roblox development, but i also have a bunch
      that want to do web, python, and minecraft modding.
    </p>

    <p>
      it's been a great time and i've learned a lot about programming through
      teaching as well as mentoring from my boss. i've also worked on some
      pretty cool projects and made some friends.
